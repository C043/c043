# Hi, I'm Mario 🤖

**I have a strong passion for programming, I take joy in building software that
adds value to the user's life.** 💻

The power of code always fascinated me. You can create anything from scratch!
It's incredibly satisfying to see a project come together, from the initial
concept to the final product.

I believe in **continuous learning** as new skills give me the power to create
new and better software!

**Let's build something awesome together! 🚀**
